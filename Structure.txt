1. Create a class for each "chromosome," Whereas the limited amount of "traits" from chromosomes
are assigned a value from 0-1 at random, in which the limited range for randomness is by 2 decimals
after 0 until 1.00, being the max possible outcome.

2. Make sure the "guess" for each assigned trait is checked to see if it's the best outcome to make progress, but also
automatically removed from the array of possible numbers. Do this by appending the biggest "confidence" value, which will
tell the program that the experiment has peaked max evolution in the tests. Use a while loops to go through the iterations

3. Do this for every trait, which will make an outcome of "Experiment x," with x being the number of trials it takes  
to be at its current stage of evolution. The product of all the traits assigned at random will be the "result"
number, and that will also be tested on how confident or unconfident the experiment is.

4. Create a GUI that can illustrate the codes action, based on its pixel density. The numbers assigned to each trait
will tell the output how to express its current state of evolution in the test trials.
